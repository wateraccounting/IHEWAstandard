Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	See ETIa by dekad for further information.

5	L1_E_D	Evaporation (Dekadal)	The Evaporation (E) data component (dekadal, in mm/day) is the actual evaporation of the soil surface. The value of each pixel represents the average daily actual evaporation for that specific dekad.

A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	The calculation of the evaporation is based on the ETLook model described in Bastiaanssen et al. (2012). It uses the Penman-Monteith equation, adapted to remote sensing input data. The Penman-Monteith equation predicts the rate of total evaporation and transpiration using commonly measured meteorological data (solar radiation, air temperature, vapour content and wind speed). It has become the FAO standard for calculating the actual and reference evapotranspiration (see FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper 56, Allen et al. 1998). The following data is used for calculating evaporation:- Daily: incoming solar radiation and weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed and precipitation);- Dekadal: NDVI, surface albedo and soil moisture stress;- Seasonal: Land Cover;- Static: Digital Elevation Model.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

6	L1_GBWP_A	Gross Biomass Water Productivity	The annual Gross Biomass Water Productivity expresses the quantity of output (total biomass production) in relation to the total volume of water consumed in the year (actual evapotranspiration). By relating biomass production to total evapotranspiration (sum of soil evaporation, canopy transpiration and interception), this indicator provides insights on the impact of vegetation development on consumptive water use and thus on water balance in a given domain. When the focus is on monitoring performance of irrigated agriculture in relation to water consumption, it is more appropriate to use transpiration alone as a denominator, as a measure of water beneficially consumed by the plant. This latter indicator, for which we use the term \"net water productivity\", provides useful information on how effectively vegetation (and particularly crops) uses water to develop its biomass (and thus yield).

A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	Evaporation of intercepted rainfall requires energy that is not available for transpiration or evaporation. Interception is a function of the vegetation cover and precipitation.Interception is relatively high with a small amount of precipitation, with the fraction intercepted decreasing quickly as precipitation increases. The maximum interception is determined by the LAI.The following data is used for calculating interception:- Daily: incoming solar radiation and weather data (temperature, humidity and precipitation);- Dekadal: NDVI.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	Land Cover Classification makes use of the dekadal reflectance time series and seasonal phenology information from the Crop Calendar. The Level 1 land cover products were derived from the Global Land Service of Copernicus, the Earth Observation programme of the European Commission. In addition, irrigated areas are identified by applying a water deficit index that takes into consideration seasonal cumulated values of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration. The classification applied is based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) that was developed by FAO. Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

10	L1_NBWP_A	Net Biomass Water Productivity	The annual Net Biomass Water Productivity expresses the quantity of output (total biomass production) in relation to the volume of water beneficially consumed (by canopy transpiration) in the year, and thus net of soil evaporation. Contrary to gross water productivity, net water productivity is particularly useful in monitoring how effectively vegetation (and, more importantly, crops) uses water to develop biomass (and thus yield).

Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	The calculation of Net Biomass Water Productivity (NBWP) is as follows: NBWP = TBP/Ta Where TBP is annual total biomass production in kgDM/ha and Ta is annual actual transpiration in m³/ha. Only areas with annual T of 100 mm or higher have been included in the computation.The following data is used for calculating it:- Annual TBP- Annual Ta	https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/catalog/workspaces/WAPOR_2/cubes/L1_NBWP_A
11	L1_NPP_D	Net Primary Production	Net Primary Production (NPP) is a fundamental characteristic of an ecosystem, expressing the conversion of carbon dioxide into biomass driven by photosynthesis.

A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	The core of the methodology for deriving NPP is detailed in Veroustraete et al. (2002), whilst the practical implementation, as developed for the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System, is described in Eerens et al. (2004). These methodologies were improved within the framework of the Copernicus Global Land Component, the most important change being the incorporation of biome-specific light-use efficiencies (LUEs).  The FRAME project applies this updated methodology, adding improvements which include the addition of a reduction factor to account for reduced water availability (i.e. soil moisture stress).The following data is used to calculate NPP:- Daily:incoming solar radiation and temperature data (Tmin/Tmax);- Dekadal:fAPAR and soil moisture stress;- Seasonal:Land Cover.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	The LST input uses each clear observation. For each clear LST observation a separate "observation quality" is calculated which is dependent on the viewing angle. Smaller viewing angles provide a better LST observation. For each day the following procedure is followed to calculate the LST:If there is no clear LST observation, then the previous value of LST is used. The observation quality is reduced 10% each day.If there is a clear LST observation then the new LST value will be a weighted mean of the previous observation and current observation, based on their observation quality.The Quality Indicator provides the number of days since the last clear observation, regardless of its observation quality.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

17	L1_QUAL_NDVI_D	Quality of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Dekadal)	The layer gives an indication of the quality of the NDVI input data.

A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	The quality layer is produced during the smoothing of the NDVI. The quality index (QI) for every pixel in each dekad depicts if and how a new value was created for that pixel. The procedure can be described as follows:1) First all the valid observations (not flagged) are treated. If the final estimate of the smoothed NDVI is very close to the (pre-cleaned) NDVI value, the QI is set to 0 (ideal situation). Where a valid observation was present but it was adapted by the smoothing, the QI is set to 250 ("valid-smoothed" in the legend).2) For the remaining (flagged) observations, the QI is set to the number of days in-between the surrounding valid observations (i.e. with QI=0 or 250). If the length of the data gap exceeds 240 days, it is saturated to 240. The fundamental idea is that the longer the gap, the less reliable the smoothing is. For the observations at the profile edges, it is assumed that the (a priori unknown) observations preceding the first valid observation and following the last valid observations are "good"This quality layer depicts the quality for the NDVI, fAPAR, albedo and NPP, as all these data components rely on the same input, i.e. the spectral reflectance data. Furthermore, the length of the data gap is the same.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

Annual TBP is the sum of the TBP by dekad in the year of reference (TBP by dekad is the average daily value in a dekad multiplied by number of days in each dekad). TBP is calculated by applying a unit conversion factor to net primary production (NPP) that converts carbon grams per m² into dry matter (DM) per hectare. In the previous version of the database, a fixed shoot/root ratio of 0.65 was applied to distribute DM into below ground and above ground production. For Version 2, also based on the findings of the Quality assessment, we decided to release the total biomass (above and below ground) instead, and leave users the possibility to apply a shoot/root ratio that better suits their analysis.	https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/catalog/workspaces/WAPOR_2/cubes/L1_TBP_A

64	L2_GBWP_S	Gross Biomass Water Productivity (Seasonal)	The seasonal Gross Biomass Water Productivity expresses the quantity of output (total biomass production) in relation to the total volume of water consumed (actual EvapoTranspiration) during the growing cycle of the vegetation. By relating biomass production to total EvapoTranspiration (sum of soil evaporation, canopy transpiration and interception), this indicator provides insights on the impact of vegetation development on consumptive water use and thus on water balance in a given domain. When the focus is on monitoring performance of irrigated agriculture in relation to water consumption, it is more appropriate to use transpiration alone as a denominator, as a measure of water beneficially consumed by the plant. This latter indicator, for which we use the term \"net water productivity\", provides useful information on how effectively vegetation (and particularly crops) uses water to develop its biomass (and thus yield).

This implies that other temporal aggregations (monthly, seasonal, annual), and layers that depend on those, are updated as well. Practically this means that a final annual aggregation of the most recent full calendar year can only be produced after the end of February. Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	The calculation of gross biomass water productivity (GBWP) is as follows: GBWP = TBP/ETIa Where TBP is seasonal Total Biomass Production in kg/ha and ETIa is the Actual EvapoTranspiration and Interception in m³/ha cumulated during the course of the growing season, as defined by the phenology information.The following data is used for calculating it:- Seasonal TBP- Dekadal ETIa- Phenology (start of season and end of season)	https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/catalog/workspaces/WAPOR_2/cubes/L2_GBWP_S
65	L2_I_A	Interception (Annual)	Interception is the process where rainfall is captured by the leaves. Part of this captured rainfall will evaporate again. The Interception (I) data component represents the evaporation of intercepted rainfall from the vegetation canopy.

66	L2_I_D	Interception (Dekadal)	The Interception (I) data component (dekadal, in mm/day) represents the evaporation of intercepted rainfall from the vegetation canopy.

A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	Evaporation of intercepted rainfall requires energy that is not available for transpiration or evaporation. Interception is a function of the vegetation cover and precipitation.Interception is relatively high with a small amount of precipitation, with the fraction intercepted decreasing quickly as precipitation increases. The maximum interception is determined by the LAI.The following data is used for calculating interception:- Daily: incoming solar radiation and weather data (temperature, humidity and precipitation);- Dekadal: NDVI.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

67	L2_LCC_A	Land Cover Classification	This experimental land cover dataset at continental scale (Level 2) shows a broad classification aiming at identifying cultivated land and, more specifically, distinguishing between irrigated and rainfed areas. It is published on a yearly basis, while seasonal products are available upon request.

Practically this means that a final annual aggregation of the most recent full calendar year can only be produced after the end of February. Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	Land Cover Classification makes use of the dekadal reflectance time series and seasonal phenology information from the Crop Calendar. The Level 1 land cover products were derived from the Global Land Service of Copernicus, the Earth Observation programme of the European Commission. This product was generated from MODIS data, using the Copernicus training data and operational workflow, modified to account for differences in spatial resolution and the delivered land cover classes. In addition, irrigated areas are identified by applying a water deficit index that takes into consideration seasonal cumulated values of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration.The classification applied is based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) that was developed by FAO.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

68	L2_NPP_D	Net Primary Production	Net Primary Production (NPP) is a fundamental characteristic of an ecosystem, expressing the conversion of carbon dioxide into biomass driven by photosynthesis. The pixel value represents the mean daily NPP for that specific dekad.	Raster Dataset	gC/m²	Int16 (16bit Integer)	the pixel value in the downloaded data must be multiplied by 0.001	-9999	100m (0.000992 degree)	Africa and Near East	EPSG:4326 - WGS84 - Geographic Coordinate System (lat/long)	from January 2009 to present	Dekadal (approximately every 10 days)	New dekadal data layers are released approximately 5 days after the end of a dekad. A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	The core of the methodology for deriving NPP is detailed in Veroustraete et al. (2002), whilst the practical implementation, as developed for the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System, is described in Eerens et al. (2004). These methodologies were improved within the framework of the Copernicus Global Land Component, the most important change being the incorporation of biome-specific light-use efficiencies (LUEs).  The FRAME project applies this updated methodology, adding improvements which include the addition of a reduction factor to account for reduced water availability (i.e. soil moisture stress).The following data is used to calculate NPP:-  Daily:incoming solar radiation and temperature data (Tmin/Tmax);- Dekadal:fAPAR and soil moisture stress;- Seasonal:Land Cover.	https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/catalog/workspaces/WAPOR_2/cubes/L2_NPP_D
69	L2_PHE_S	Phenology (Seasonal)	Phenology indicates the cycle or season of a crop and, in this case, is defined by the dekad (D) corresponding to the start, maximum and end of the growing season. This information can be derived from satellite-based vegetation index time series. Phenology is delivered for a maximum of two growing seasons annually. The phenology for one growing season is therefore delivered as three raster files. The first raster indicates the Start of Season (SOS), the second the Maximum of Season (MOS) and the third represents the End of Season (EOS). With a maximum of 2 growing seasons annually, a full year is described by 6 raster files. The pixel values of the phenology data components are expressed in dekad numbers.	Raster Dataset	D (dekad number)	Byte (8bit Unsigned Integer)		255	100m (0.000992 degree)	Africa and Near East	EPSG:4326 - WGS84 - Geographic Coordinate System (lat/long)	from January 2009 to present	Seasonal	New dekadal data layers are released approximately 5 days after the end of a dekad. A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations. This implies that other temporal aggregations (monthly, seasonal, annual), and layers that depend on those, are updated as well. Practically this means that a final annual aggregation of the most recent full calendar year can only be produced after the end of February. Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	The year that contains the Maximum of season determines the year a growing season is attributed to (i.e. the target year). As the crop calendar is determined from a three-year NDVI time series with the target year in the middle, dekad numbers range between 1 and 108 (3 x 36 = 108 dekads). Since it occurs in the target year, MOS has a value between 37 and 72. Start of season pixel values must be smaller than 72, whilst End of season pixel values must be larger than 36. 254 denotes "no season" (if no growing season can be distinguished), and 253 "out of season". The Start, Maximum and End of up to two seasons for a given calendar year (January - December) is derived by applying  the methodology described by Van Hoolst et al. (see methodology document for references).This methodology can derive phenological information from a time series of dekadal vegetation index composites, in this case NDVI.The following data is used to calculate Phenology:- NDVI	https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/catalog/workspaces/WAPOR_2/cubes/L2_PHE_S
70	L2_QUAL_LST_D	Quality Land Surface Temperature (Dekadal)	The quality layer gives an indication on the quality of the Land Surface Temperature (LST) input data. It shows the time between the date of the data file and the earlier remote sensing observation on which the data is based.	Raster Dataset	d	Byte (8bit Integer)		255	100m (0.000992 degree)	Africa and Near East	EPSG:4326 - WGS84 - Geographic Coordinate System (lat/long)	from January 2009 to present	Dekadal (approximately every 10 days)	New dekadal data layers are released approximately 5 days after the end of a dekad. A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	The LST input uses each clear observation. For each clear LST observation a separate "observation quality" is calculated which is dependent on the viewing angle. Smaller viewing angles provide a better LST observation. For each day the following procedure is followed to calculate the LST:If there is no clear LST observation, then the previous value of LST is used. The observation quality is reduced 10% each day.If there is a clear LST observation then the new LST value will be a weighted mean of the previous observation and current observation, based on their observation quality.The Quality Indicator provides the number of days since the last clear observation, regardless of its observation quality.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

71	L2_QUAL_NDVI_D	Quality of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Dekadal)	The layer gives an indication of the quality of the NDVI input data. It shows whether a valid observation was available for that dekad, and if not, the length of the data gap with the nearest valid observation.	Raster Dataset	d	Byte (8bit Unsigned Integer)		255	100m (0.000992 degree)	Africa and Near East	EPSG:4326 - WGS84 - Geographic Coordinate System (lat/long)	from January 2009 to present	Dekadal (approximately every 10 days)	New dekadal data layers are released approximately 5 days after the end of a dekad. A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	The quality layer is produced during the smoothing of the NDVI. The quality index (QI) for every pixel in each dekad depicts if and how a new value was created for that pixel. The procedure can be described as follows:1) First all the valid observations (not flagged) are treated. If the final estimate of the smoothed NDVI is very close to the (pre-cleaned) NDVI value, the QI is set to 0 (ideal situation). Where a valid observation was present but it was adapted by the smoothing, the QI is set to 250 ("valid-smoothed" in the legend).2) For the remaining (flagged) observations, the QI is set to the number of days in-between the surrounding valid observations (i.e. with QI=0 or 250). If the length of the data gap exceeds 240 days, it is saturated to 240. The fundamental idea is that the longer the gap, the less reliable the smoothing is. For the observations at the profile edges, it is assumed that the (a priori unknown) observations preceding the first valid observation and following the last valid observations are "good"This quality layer depicts the quality for the NDVI, fAPAR, albedo and NPP, as all these data components rely on the same input, i.e. the spectral reflectance data. Furthermore, the length of the data gap is the same.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

72	L2_T_A	Transpiration (Annual)	The Transpiration (T) data component is the actual transpiration of the vegetation canopy.

Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	See transpiration (T) by dekad for further information.

73	L2_TBP_S	Total Biomass Production (Seasonal)	Total Biomass Production (TBP) is defined as the sum of the above-ground dry matter produced during the course of the growing season. The seasonal value represents the total accumulated biomass during one growing season, from start of season (SOS) to end of season (EOS). A pixel value of -9997 denotes \"out of season\".

A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations. This implies that other temporal aggregations (monthly, seasonal, annual), and layers that depend on those, are updated as well. Practically this means that a final annual aggregation of the most recent full calendar year can only be produced after the end of February. Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	To derive the accumulation in biomass production over or during a growing season, first the start and the end of the growing season need to be identified using the phenology data component. TBP is then calculated as the sum of NPP, converted into dry matter productivity (DMP) units (kg/ha), between the start of the season (SOS) and the end of the season (EOS).At the end of the season, when the crops for the area can be assessed, the dekadal and seasonal TBP values are adjusted using an additional root-shoot correction factor data layer that allows the user to correct the TBP using the land cover specific root-shoot values.A limitation for the derivation of TBP is the dependency on phenological information, meaning that TBP can only be derived for areas where seasonality is detected. For ecosystems, such as tropical forests or deserts, that experience almost no seasonality, the start of season is theoretically set at January 1st and end of season is set at December 31st.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

Practically this means that a final annual aggregation of the most recent full calendar year can only be produced after the end of February. Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	See interception (I) by dekad for further information.

81	L3_AWA_I_D	Interception (Awash, Ethiopia - Dekadal)	The Interception (I) data component (dekadal, in mm/day) represents the evaporation of intercepted rainfall from the vegetation canopy. Interception is the process where rainfall is captured by the leaves. Part of this captured rainfall will evaporate again. The value of each pixel represents the average daily evaporated interception for that specific dekad.

A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	Evaporation of intercepted rainfall requires energy that is not available for transpiration or evaporation. Interception is a function of the vegetation cover and precipitation.Interception is relatively high with a small amount of precipitation, with the fraction intercepted decreasing quickly as precipitation increases. The maximum interception is determined by the LAI.The following data is used for calculating interception:- Daily: incoming solar radiation and weather data (temperature, humidity and precipitation);- Dekadal: NDVI.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations. This implies that other temporal aggregations (monthly, seasonal, annual), and layers that depend on those, are updated as well. Practically this means that a final annual aggregation of the most recent full calendar year can only be produced after the end of February. Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	See interception (I) by dekad for further information.

The maximum interception is determined by the LAI.The following data is used for calculating interception:- Daily: incoming solar radiation and weather data (temperature, humidity and precipitation);- Dekadal: NDVI.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

122	L3_ODN_NPP_D	Net Primary Production (Office du Niger, Mali - Dekadal)	Net Primary Production (NPP) is a fundamental characteristic of an ecosystem, expressing the conversion of carbon dioxide into biomass driven by photosynthesis. The pixel value represents the mean daily NPP for that specific dekad.	Raster Dataset	g/m²	Int16 (16bit Integer)	the pixel value in the downloaded data must be multiplied by 0.001	-9999	30m	Office du Niger, Mali	EPSG:32630 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 30N	from January 2009 to present	Dekadal (approximately every 10 days)	New dekadal data layers are released approximately 5 days after the end of a dekad. A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations.	The core of the methodology for deriving NPP is detailed in Veroustraete et al. (2002), whilst the practical implementation, as developed for the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System, is described in Eerens et al. (2004). These methodologies were improved within the framework of the Copernicus Global Land Component, the most important change being the incorporation of biome-specific light-use efficiencies (LUEs).  The FRAME project applies this updated methodology, adding improvements which include the addition of a reduction factor to account for reduced water availability (i.e. soil moisture stress).The following data is used to calculate NPP:-  Daily:incoming solar radiation and temperature data (Tmin/Tmax);- Dekadal:fAPAR and soil moisture stress;- Seasonal:Land Cover.	https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/catalog/workspaces/WAPOR_2/cubes/L3_ODN_NPP_D
123	L3_ODN_T_A	Transpiration (Office du Niger, Mali - Annual)	The Transpiration (T) data component is the actual transpiration of the vegetation canopy.

A higher quality version of the same data layer is uploaded after 6 dekads have passed. This final version of the dekadal dataset has a higher quality because gap filling and interpolation processes, where needed, have been based on more data observations. This implies that other temporal aggregations (monthly, seasonal, annual), and layers that depend on those, are updated as well. Practically this means that a final annual aggregation of the most recent full calendar year can only be produced after the end of February. Likewise, the final monthly aggregation of the most recent calendar months can only be produced 2 full months later.	See transpiration (T) by dekad for further information. The annual total is obtained by taking the T in mm/day, multiplying by the number of days in a dekad, and summing the dekads of each year.	https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/catalog/workspaces/WAPOR_2/cubes/L3_ODN_T_A

The calculation of the transpiration is based on the ETLook model described in Bastiaanssen et al. (2012). It uses the Penman-Monteith equation, adapted to remote sensing input data. The Penman-Monteith equation predicts the rate of total evaporation and transpiration using commonly measured meteorological data (solar radiation, air temperature, vapour content and wind speed). It has become the FAO standard for calculating the actual and reference evapotranspiration (see FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper 56, Allen et al. 1998).The following data is used for calculating transpiration:- Daily: incoming solar radiation and weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed and precipitation);- Dekadal: NDVI, surface albedo and soil moisture stress;- Seasonal: Land Cover;- Static: Digital Elevation Model.Data component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.
