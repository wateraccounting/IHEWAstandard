By relating biomass production to total evapotranspiration (sum of soil evaporation, canopy transpiration and interception), this indicator provides insights on the impact of vegetation development on consumptive water use and thus on water balance in a given domain. When the focus is on monitoring performance of irrigated agriculture in relation to water consumption, it is more appropriate to use transpiration alone as a denominator, as a measure of water beneficially consumed by the plant. This latter indicator, for which we use the term \\\"net water productivity\\\", provides useful information on how effectively vegetation (and particularly crops) uses water to develop its biomass (and thus yield).",

These methodologies were improved within the framework of the Copernicus Global Land Component, the most important change being the incorporation of biome-specific light-use efficiencies (LUEs).  The FRAME project applies this updated methodology, adding improvements which include the addition of a reduction factor to account for reduced water availability (i.e. soil moisture stress).\n\nThe following data is used to calculate NPP:\n\n- Daily:incoming solar radiation and temperature data (Tmin/Tmax);\n\n- Dekadal:fAPAR and soil moisture stress;\n\n- Seasonal:Land Cover.\n\nData component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

The quality index (QI) for every pixel in each dekad depicts if and how a new value was created for that pixel. The procedure can be described as follows:\n\n1) First all the valid observations (not flagged) are treated. If the final estimate of the smoothed NDVI is very close to the (pre-cleaned) NDVI value, the QI is set to 0 (ideal situation). Where a valid observation was present but it was adapted by the smoothing, the QI is set to 250 (\"valid-smoothed\" in the legend).\n\n2) For the remaining (flagged) observations, the QI is set to the number of days in-between the surrounding valid observations (i.e. with QI=0 or 250). If the length of the data gap exceeds 240 days, it is saturated to 240. The fundamental idea is that the longer the gap, the less reliable the smoothing is. For the observations at the profile edges, it is assumed that the (a priori unknown) observations preceding the first valid observation and following the last valid observations are \"good\"\n\nThis quality layer depicts the quality for the NDVI, fAPAR, albedo and NPP, as all these data components rely on the same input, i.e. the spectral reflectance data. Furthermore, the length of the data gap is the same.\n\nData component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

By relating biomass production to total EvapoTranspiration (sum of soil evaporation, canopy transpiration and interception), this indicator provides insights on the impact of vegetation development on consumptive water use and thus on water balance in a given domain. When the focus is on monitoring performance of irrigated agriculture in relation to water consumption, it is more appropriate to use transpiration alone as a denominator, as a measure of water beneficially consumed by the plant. This latter indicator, for which we use the term \\\"net water productivity\\\", provides useful information on how effectively vegetation (and particularly crops) uses water to develop its biomass (and thus yield).",

The quality index (QI) for every pixel in each dekad depicts if and how a new value was created for that pixel. The procedure can be described as follows:\n\n1) First all the valid observations (not flagged) are treated. If the final estimate of the smoothed NDVI is very close to the (pre-cleaned) NDVI value, the QI is set to 0 (ideal situation). Where a valid observation was present but it was adapted by the smoothing, the QI is set to 250 (\"valid-smoothed\" in the legend).\n\n2) For the remaining (flagged) observations, the QI is set to the number of days in-between the surrounding valid observations (i.e. with QI=0 or 250). If the length of the data gap exceeds 240 days, it is saturated to 240. The fundamental idea is that the longer the gap, the less reliable the smoothing is. For the observations at the profile edges, it is assumed that the (a priori unknown) observations preceding the first valid observation and following the last valid observations are \"good\"\n\nThis quality layer depicts the quality for the NDVI, fAPAR, albedo and NPP, as all these data components rely on the same input, i.e. the spectral reflectance data. Furthermore, the length of the data gap is the same.\n\nData component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

For ecosystems, such as tropical forests or deserts, that experience almost no seasonality, the start of season is theoretically set at January 1st and end of season is set at December 31st.\n\nData component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

It uses the Penman-Monteith equation, adapted to remote sensing input data. The Penman-Monteith equation predicts the rate of total evaporation and transpiration using commonly measured meteorological data (solar radiation, air temperature, vapour content and wind speed). It has become the FAO standard for calculating the actual and reference evapotranspiration (see FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper 56, Allen et al. 1998).\n\nThe following data is used for calculating evaporation:\n\n- Daily: incoming solar radiation and weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed and precipitation);\n\n- Dekadal: NDVI, surface albedo and soil moisture stress;\n\n- Seasonal: Land Cover;\n\n- Static: Digital Elevation Model.\n\nData component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.

The Penman-Monteith equation predicts the rate of total evaporation and transpiration using commonly measured meteorological data (solar radiation, air temperature, vapour content and wind speed). It has become the FAO standard for calculating the actual and reference evapotranspiration (see FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper 56, Allen et al. 1998).\n\nThe following data is used for calculating transpiration:\n\n- Daily: incoming solar radiation and weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed and precipitation);\n\n- Dekadal: NDVI, surface albedo and soil moisture stress;\n\n- Seasonal: Land Cover;\n\n- Static: Digital Elevation Model.\n\nData component developed through collaboration with the FRAME Consortium.
